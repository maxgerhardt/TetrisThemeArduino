Tetris Theme Arduino with PlatformIO
====================================

Plays the Tetris theme song from a digital arduino pin. Just connect a piezo or
speaker to **PIN 12** & **GND**.

You might also want to use one NPN transistor as an amplifier to get louder sound. See https://startingelectronics.org/beginners/circuits/arduino-buzzer/.

This is a PlatformIO project and used for testing new debugging capabilities for the STM8 platform.
